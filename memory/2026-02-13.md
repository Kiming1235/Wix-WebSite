- Diagnosed CHZZK chat issue in company network context.
- Reproduced symptom directly: CHZZK live page showed right chat panel header but no message body; standalone `/chat` endpoint displayed `채팅을 사용할 수 없습니다.`.
- Twitch chat still worked, indicating service-specific path/policy block rather than general browser failure.
- Durable takeaway: when CHZZK video loads but chat fails on corporate network, likely chat transport/domain path is blocked by company policy/proxy.
- Self-serve mitigations provided: Chrome Secure DNS (Cloudflare/Google), disable QUIC flag, clear CHZZK site data, disable network-filtering extensions, and use personal hotspot as practical bypass.
